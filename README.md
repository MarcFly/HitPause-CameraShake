#Pause  
As simple as it sounds, pausing a game consist in stopping most of the core of the game to the bare minimum interactions decided by the games' developer itself. Whenever you go to setting, you check on your inventory,etc... most of the games focus solely on that task in order to save resources, and top give a thinking time to the player to perform the required actions out of the "in-game" environment.

#The first instances of Pause in videogames  
Given that the first videogames console (widely available for the general public) was available around late 1972, it took long for this feature to reach the market. In 1976, the **_Fairchild Channel F_** console was launched, which came with the first own microprocessor, consoles previously sold were made with discrete electronic components (such as transistors, resistors,...) and discrete logic (mainly logic gates).  This allowed for the system to perform tasks simultaneously to the player, allowing for the first AI subroutines, and the pause feature, thanks to a communication between the cartridge and the main microprocessor.
